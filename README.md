# SQL Queries for World Database Analysis

## Motivation
The primary motivation for this project was to enhance SQL proficiency by exploring practical, real-world datasets. The World Database provides a diverse set of tables and data points, making it an excellent resource for learning and practicing SQL techniques.

## Why This Project?
This project was built to answer meaningful questions about the world's demographics, languages, and economies using SQL queries. It bridges theoretical learning with hands-on application, enabling deeper insights into data manipulation and retrieval.

## Problem Statement
The project addresses the need to extract, manipulate, and analyze structured data efficiently. By answering questions such as identifying the least populated country or categorizing countries based on GNP, it demonstrates SQL's versatility in solving real-world problems.

## Key Learnings
- **SQL Basics:** Proficiency in SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN operations.
- **Advanced Queries:** Mastery of aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions.
- **Problem-Solving:** Translating questions into SQL queries for data insights.
- **Categorization:** Using CASE statements to classify data meaningfully.

## Standout Features
1. **Diverse Query Set:** Includes examples like calculating averages, categorizing data, and finding top-ranking records.
2. **Window Functions:** Demonstrates SUM, AVG, and MAX with `PARTITION BY`.
3. **Categorization:** Implements GNP-based country classification into Developed, Developing, Underdeveloped, and Poor.
4. **Join Queries:** Combines tables for enriched data insights, e.g., finding languages spoken in a country.
5. **Practical Applications:** Addresses real-world scenarios, such as identifying government types or life expectancy in Asia.

## Features
1. **Top 5 Records:** Displays the first five records of the `City` table.
2. **Minimum Population:** Finds the country with the lowest population.
3. **Language Insights:** Counts distinct languages starting with "E."
4. **Pattern Matching:** Identifies districts starting with "a" and ending with "h."
5. **Population Ranking:** Displays the top 3 most populated countries.
6. **Government Type Analysis:** Lists countries with "Republic" government types.
7. **Life Expectancy:** Computes the average life expectancy for Asia.
8. **Country Details:** Retrieves the country name, region, and languages for "India."
9. **GNP Categorization:** Classifies countries based on GNP levels.
10. **English Language Analysis:** Finds countries with English percentages above average.
11. **Population Metrics:** Provides sum, average, and maximum population per country code.
12. **Surface Area Ranking:** Lists the top 5 largest countries by surface area.
